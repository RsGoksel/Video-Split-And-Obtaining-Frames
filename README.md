# VideoSplit-And-Get-Frames-From-It
The code will split your .mp4 video and get frames from it. 
After that, these frames merges together. The point of this Repository is if you wish you can apply any improvements on images like ESRGAN or etc. after getting output frames from video. 
You can merge them and get new video from updated images. New video also will protect its FPS value.
