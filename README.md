# VideoSplit-And-Get-Frames-From-It
The code will split your .mp4 videos and get frames from it. 
After that, these frames merges together. If you wish you can apply any improvements on images like ESRGAN or etc.
After getting output frames from video, you can merge them and get video from updated images. New video will protect its FPS value.
